# Self-Analysis-COVID-19-Test-Software
The project is specifically designed for institutes, in order to keep the COVID-19 result status and make students and teachers aware about their situation. The software asks the userâ€™s general data, like name, age, blood group and vaccination information. Afterwards, user is asked 5 questions. As the user answers the questions, a report is formulated using the input data and a record is saved whether the user is COVID-19 positive or COVID-19 negative.
